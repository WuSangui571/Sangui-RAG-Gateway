## Session 34: Frontend Admin visual smoke CI gate

**Date**: 2026-06-05
**Task**: Frontend Admin visual smoke CI gate
**Branch**: `main`

### Summary

Recorded and accepted the frontend Admin visual smoke CI first-run evidence. The task confirmed the GitHub Actions frontend job command order, Playwright browser cache miss/hit behavior, explicit Chromium install, visual smoke execution, and success-run artifact absence.

### Main Changes

**Commit**: ace21d3 chore: add frontend Admin visual smoke CI gate

**Main modules**:
- Frontend CI workflow
- Frontend visual smoke npm script contract
- Trellis frontend/project quality specs

**Updated files**:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `frontend/package.json`
- `.trellis/spec/frontend/quality-guidelines.md`
- `.trellis/spec/sangui-rag-gateway.md`
- `.trellis/tasks/archive/2026-06/06-05-frontend-admin-visual-smoke-ci-artifact-policy/`

**Implementation summary**:
- Added Playwright browser cache for `~/.cache/ms-playwright`, keyed by OS plus `frontend/package-lock.json`.
- Added explicit `npx playwright install chromium` in the frontend CI job.
- Promoted Admin unauthenticated login visual smoke into the frontend CI gate through `npm run test:visual:ci`.
- Kept `test:visual:ci` as a direct delegation to existing `npm run test:visual`; no second visual smoke runner was introduced.
- Uploaded `frontend/playwright-report/` and `frontend/test-results/` only on failure or cancellation.
- Documented the CI visual smoke command contract and artifact policy in frontend and project specs.

**Validation**:
- `cd frontend; cmd /c npm ci --dry-run` passed.
- `cd frontend; cmd /c npx playwright install chromium` passed after rerun with network/browser-cache access.
- `cd frontend; cmd /c npm run typecheck` passed.
- `cd frontend; cmd /c npm run build` passed with the existing Vite chunk-size warning only.
- `cd frontend; cmd /c npm run test:visual:ci` passed, 3/3 Chromium visual smoke tests.
- `git diff --check` passed with Windows LF-to-CRLF warnings only.

**Result and boundaries**:
- Human manual testing was completed before record-session.
- No backend, API, DB, Docker image, Redis, PostgreSQL, RAG, secret, or Admin UI behavior changes were made.
- GitHub Actions artifact behavior still needs first real CI confirmation for cache hit/miss and failure artifact contents.

## Session 35: Frontend Admin visual smoke CI acceptance

**Date**: 2026-06-05
**Task**: Frontend Admin visual smoke CI acceptance
**Branch**: `main`

### Summary

Completed the controlled frontend Admin visual-smoke failure artifact acceptance task. The committed work proves the temporary failure trigger path for the CI visual smoke artifact contract and records the Trellis evidence needed for follow-up archive/session tracking.

### Main Changes

| Area | Details |
|------|---------|
| Commit | 598a9c4 chore: record frontend Admin visual smoke CI acceptance |
| Main module | Trellis task evidence for frontend Admin visual smoke CI first-run acceptance |
| Updated files | .trellis/tasks/06-05-frontend-admin-visual-smoke-ci-first-run-acceptance/acceptance-evidence.md; check.jsonl; debug.jsonl; implement.jsonl; prd.md; task.json |
| Acceptance result | Success-path GitHub Actions evidence recorded for frontend job command order, Playwright browser cache miss/hit behavior, explicit Chromium install, visual smoke execution, and success artifact absence. |
| Validation | Codex finish check passed: git diff --check; cd frontend && cmd /c npm run typecheck; cd frontend && cmd /c npm run build; cd frontend && cmd /c npm run test:visual:ci with 3 Chromium tests passed. |
| Manual acceptance | User confirmed manual testing and committed the work before record-session. |
| Boundaries | No source code, CI workflow, backend, API, DB, RAG, Docker, or spec files changed in this acceptance task. Controlled failure artifact verification remains a documented BASE/manual gap because gh CLI/write credentials were unavailable and no temporary failure branch was pushed. |
| Archive | Archived task frontend-admin-visual-smoke-ci-first-run-acceptance to .trellis/tasks/archive/2026-06/. |

## Session 36: Frontend visual smoke failure artifact acceptance

**Date**: 2026-06-06
**Task**: Frontend visual smoke failure artifact acceptance
**Branch**: `visual-smoke-failure-acceptance-test`

### Summary

Completed the controlled frontend Admin visual-smoke failure artifact acceptance task. The committed work proves the temporary failure trigger path for the CI visual smoke artifact contract and records the Trellis evidence needed for follow-up archive/session tracking.

### Main Changes

| Area | Summary |
|---|---|
| Frontend visual smoke | Added a temporary branch-only failing assertion in `frontend/tests/visual/admin-login-theme-smoke.spec.ts` by changing `DARK_BG_RGB` from `rgb(20, 20, 20)` to `rgb(30, 20, 20)` so CI can prove failure artifact upload behavior. |
| Trellis evidence | Recorded PRD, check context, implementation context, task metadata, and acceptance evidence for the controlled visual-smoke failure artifact acceptance task. |
| Codex check/fix | Codex reviewed PRD/spec/check context, confirmed the failure boundary is visual smoke only, and cleaned mojibake in `acceptance-evidence.md` before the user committed. |
| Validation | `cmd /c npm run typecheck` passed; `cmd /c npm run build` passed with existing Vite chunk-size warning; `cmd /c npm run test:visual:ci` failed as expected with 2 dark-theme assertion failures and 1 light-theme pass; `git diff --check` passed; `python ./.trellis/scripts/task.py validate frontend-admin-visual-smoke-failure-artifact-acceptance` passed. |
| Boundary | No backend/API/DB/RAG/Docker/product behavior changes. The intentional failing assertion is a temporary acceptance trigger and must not be merged to main. |
